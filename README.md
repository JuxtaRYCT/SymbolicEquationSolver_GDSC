This is the repository of a symbolic equation solver made by Yash Raj Singh

This code uses regular expression to separate the various terms of the quadratic equation and then finds the possible cases of solution for the quadratic equation and calculates the roots of the quadratic equation.

A quadratic equation has the following 3 cases:

Discriminant=0(The equation has a single root)
Discriminant>0(the equation has real roots)
Discriminant<0(The equation has imaginary roots)
